# The International 2025 Survival Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Crimson Witnesses event guide for The International 2025 in Hamburg! The purpose of this guide is to disseminate information relevant to an overall positive experience of the event by answering questions you may have and giving information that may otherwise be hard to find. Information contained within this guide is based on travel experiences to Hamburg, hours of research, community feedback from those living in the area, feedback from attendees of previous ESL events that have been held at the same location, and my own experience at TIs 4-13! I hope that this guide will result in a relaxing, enjoyable, exciting, and safe trip for as many attendees as possible. This is a live document and will be updated with feedback as new information becomes available. Please check the FAQ and leave any additional comments or questions on the Crimson Witnesses Discord or the Reddit post.

## Transportation

### Airport

[Hamburg Airport - HAM - Flughafenstr. 1-3, 22335 Hamburg, Germany](https://www.hamburg-airport.de/en)

The transfer from Hamburg Airport to the centre of Hamburg is seamless. From arrival at the central station local trains and public transport are available to the other localities in the city.

#### Transport from Airport

- **Train**

  S-Bahn line S1 takes you from Hamburg Central Station to the airport and back every 10 minutes with a journey time of only 25 minutes each way. You can reach the S-Bahn _Hamburg Airport (Flughafen)_ station directly from Terminals 1 and 2 (Arrivals) via elevators, escalators, and fixed stairs. One stop from _Hamburg Airport_, at the _Ohlsdorf_ underground station, you have the option of changing to the U1 underground line. From previous experience at ESL events in the city, most people opt to stay on the S1 line straight into the city.

- **Bus**

  Another option is to take the bus from the airport to the city centre. The Line 606 bus runs every 30 minutes and takes around 25 minutes to get to the central train station. The cost for a one-way ticket is ~3.30 euros, and you can purchase tickets at the airport or on the bus. There are night buses available also, but the S-Bahn line to the central station is a better option at night. If you would like to use the bus for your onward journey, you will find the stops directly in front of Terminal 1 on Level 0 (arrival).

- **Taxi**

  For a safe and comfortable journey into the city, taxis are available at the taxi stands in front of Terminals 1 and 2. Payments in the taxis can be made in cash as well as cashless; booster seats are available on request. Taking a taxi is one of the fastest and most convenient options to get to the city center. From Hamburg Airport to the city center, the journey takes around 25 minutes in normal traffic conditions. On average, a taxi from Hamburg Airport to the city center costs ~€32.50 during the day and ~€35.70 at night for up to four people.

- **Car**

  There are several car hire options available in Terminals 1 and 2 at the airport. Parking within the city can be expensive and difficult to do at busier times, so making use of the public transport options is recommended.

#### Transport To Venue

##### Public transport (HVV):

Hamburg boasts an extensive public transport system including underground trains, a light-rail network, buses and ferries. The HVV route planner and tickets app (available on iOS and Android) can be used to purchase tickets locally and offers a very useful route planner system in the app, selecting the best route and ticket option. From experience attending previous events in Hamburg, there are always plenty of ticket stations available at all stations, so purchasing all ticket types is easy should you not want to or are unable to download the app.

The HVV Website can also be used ahead of time to plan in advance for your journeys. [Accessible here!](https://www.hvv.de/en/onlineshop)

### **General Info**

[Barclays Arena](https://www.barclays-arena.de/) (originally known as the Color Line Arena and formerly known as barclaycard arena and O2 World Hamburg) is a multipurpose [arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena) in [Hamburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg), [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany). It opened in 2002 and can hold up to 16,000 people (13,800 or 12,947 for sporting events). It is located at [Altona Volkspark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altona_Volkspark), adjacent to the football stadium [Volksparkstadion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksparkstadion) and the [Volksbank Arena](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksbank_Arena) in Hamburg's western [Bahrenfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrenfeld) district.

Since opening in November 2002, the Barclays Arena in Hamburg has hosted over 2,500 events, including concerts with Elton John, Ed Sheeran, Metallica, Adele, Jay-Z, the Global Citizen Festival and Olivia Rodrigo, as well as sporting events such as ESL ONE, European and World Handball Championships and heavyweight boxing matches. Every year, over 1 million visitors flock to the more than 130 events.

## **Accommodations**

Hamburg has a wide range of accommodation options, including hotels, hostels, Air Bnbs, and private hires.

Due to the large variety of available options, we have provided a breakdown of the major areas of the city to aid you in deciding what will work best for you.

<center>

![City Map](./images/city.png)

</center>

### **City Center – Altstadt & Neu Stadt**

Hamburg's Old Town is a hub of culture and activity. Running alongside the Elbe, it not only provides wonderful canalside strolling opportunities but is home to many beautiful and historic buildings.

They all look incredibly well-kept, but in fact, a lot of them had to be painstakingly rebuilt after the bombing during World War II. That doesn't detract any from the experience though.

> [!Tip]
>
> This is a pretty good shout for those staying for the first time in Germany/Hamburg as it's reasonably safe and gives a good representation of the city itself. Some of the nicer hotels here can be a bit pricier, but they might be worth it for some!

### **St Georg**

Northeast of the Altstadt, the St Georg district spans from seedy sex shops around Hamburg’s central station to luxury hotels and penthouse apartments overlooking the Outer Alster lake.

The Hamburg Pride parade kicks off here each year, and the neighborhood remains the most vibrant LGBTQ quarter in town, centered around the hundreds of buzzing bars and cafés along the Lange Reihe. St Georg is also a thriving multi-ethnic community with many Turkish, Indian, Iranian, and Afghan eateries and minimarkets along the Steindamm and around Hansaplatz Square.

> [!Tip]
>
> If it can be avoided, it is advised not to stay here at all possible. The area is known as being unpleasant, and from reviews of those who have lived in this locality, it is reported that the area can become very unpleasant and unsafe at night, especially for those traveling alone, in pairs, or in small groups. Having said that, for those with a smaller budget, there are some great options here at a very, very reasonable price! This area will almost certainly offer the cheapest rates on accommodation!

### **St Paulis**

Say hello to one of Europe's largest party districts!. The best pubs and clubs are here! The lively Reeperbahn sits in the middle, while surrounding it lies a swathe of fast food joints, nightlife, live music bars, and places to hang out. It’s loud, proud, and many a tourist head here for a good time! .

Head a bit further out, and you'll uncover a network of affordable bars down narrow alleys, including Große Freiheit, where the Beatles famously found their feet!

> [!Tip]
>
> This is a great place to stay for those wanting to be where there is plenty to do during the day and night while staying in Hamburg for the event. Staying here also offers a great central location with easy access to the rest of the city and easy links to public transport. This is a great place to stay for those coming in groups or looking for more to do at night after the event ends. Many of the more attractive accommodation options will go early here due to its popularity amongst tourists, so book early!

### **Hafencity**

South of Hamburg Altstadt, 1 km (under a mile) away from it, Hafencity is one of the most modern areas in town. Known as Europe’s largest regeneration project, the neighborhood has seen many transformations in the last few years. Hafencity’s port area was completely rebuilt and has the largest warehouse district in the world, with canals running through the area and footbridges connecting the separate buildings.

This place is super unique, so of course, it was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

> [!Tip]
>
> This is a good place to stay if you want somewhere a bit quieter away from the crowds with plenty still to see and access to the city. Hotel and accommodation options here are not as widely available as some of the other areas mentioned here and can be quite pricey, but the area does present itself as a very unique location to stay.

### **SternSchanze**

Once the beating heart of Hamburg counter-culture, the Sternschanze—also known as the Sternschanze or simply the “Schanze”—is known as the hipster or alternative area of the city offering a lot to see for visitors to the area.

The Schanze remains one of the most engaging neighborhoods in Hamburg, with elegant buildings and a number of great bars, cafes, clubs, record stores, antique shops, and independent boutiques.

> [!Tip]
>
> This area offers some cool and reasonably priced accommodation options for those visiting for the event. There is a range of private hire accommodations, hotels and hostels here and the area might be perfect for those wanting to stay in an area with lots of character, things to do but all while staying for a reasonable price.

### **Dammtor**

Dammtor is located to the North of the City Center, 3.3 km (2 miles) away from the Hamburg Townhall. If you’re traveling for business or luxury or want to make your trip as convenient as possible, consider this area!

Dammtor is also where a big train station is located, so you can stay in the area if you’re only visiting Hamburg for a short time, for a business conference, or plan to take day trips around the country.   
The downside of staying here is that there are no notable attractions. But you’re a quick 7-minute U-Han ride away from the City Center and will have a peaceful sleep at night!

> [!Tip]
>
> Accommodation options here are a bit more expensive than some of the other areas of the city, but this might suit those willing to spend a bit more while staying the city or for those that value a good night's sleep. This area, from previous experience, offers easy access to public transport to friends that also may be staying in other areas for the event!

### **Altona Altstadt**

Altona-Altstadt is located some 3 km (1.8 miles) from the City Center. If you’re traveling on a budget and want to find an affordable hotel, this district is one of the best places to stay in the city! Its relaxed, urban, and leafy vibe makes it suitable for both families and couples or those looking for a quieter area.

The district is also situated on the Elbe River, which means you’ll have some pretty awesome views, maybe even from your hotel room! 

> [!Tip]
>
> This area might be useful for those that are booking accommodation a lot closer in time to the event. With this area being a little further from the cities, prices on accommodation can be very reasonable and will more than likely be rooms available here a lot closer to the time of the event!

---

## **Cuisine and Refreshment**

### **At the Venue**

Barclays Arena’s concourses boast a total of 17 fast food outlets offering a huge selection of international fast food specialties. Look forward to pizza, bratwurst, burgers, or wraps as well as numerous sweet and savory snacks from popcorn to ice cream to nachos. Of course, you can also quench your thirst at all our fast food outlets.

#### Veggie & Vegan

To ensure that all visitors get their culinary money's worth, since 2019, there has been an outlet in the Barclays Arena where you can get vegetarian and vegan food. You will find the outlet in the lower tier in the U5 area.

#### Onstage Food Corner

Would you like to start your stay at the Barclays Arena in a relaxed atmosphere? Then we recommend a visit to OnStage, which you will find in the basement of the arena.

A small menu awaits you in our self-service restaurant with 180 seats. All dishes are freshly prepared in front of your eyes in the open kitchen. The location is also ideal for company events, family celebrations, or club meetings - whether small or large. To get to the OnStage, use the stairs behind the HOLSTEN Bar on the lower level. On event days, we open at the start of admission (usually two hours before the start of the event; in exceptional cases, only one hour before) and offer extra access to the interior. Feel free to drop by - the OnStage is generally open to the public.

#### Can I bring my own food and drinks to events at the Barclays Arena?

It is generally prohibited to bring any food and drink into the Barclays Arena. Exceptions apply to guests who must bring food and drink into the arena due to illness upon presentation of a medical certificate or appropriate identification. Catering for babies and small children is also excluded from the ban.

### **Near the Venue**

Food options near the arena are fairly limited. These are the closest, but you should expect a trip to them to take an hour or more between walking and eating. Many more options are available within the locality but would require either public transport, a taxi, or a car share with others at the event.

### [Minatur Wunderland](https://youtu.be/R669l5CA1YA)

> “Welcome to Miniatur Wunderland, the world's largest model railway!”

More than 1,100 trains with over 10,000 wagons, as well as 137,000 trees, 289,000 figures, 10,250 cars, 47 airplanes in the air, 16,138 meters of track, and 4,340 buildings and bridges were set up by more than 300 employees in over 990,000 hours of loving, detailed work. In this superlative model construction landscape, you will see realistic train operations completely controlled by a computer. It even becomes day and night in the railroad world—and that every 15 minutes. Recently, the Miniatur Wunderland presented the HafenCity Hamburg and the Elbphilharmonie in miniature. Look forward to what is probably the world's smallest concert hall!

Tickets here range anywhere from 10 to 20 Euros depending on the day and time of day you visit. It is worth booking ahead of time to beat the queues. This has saved me a lot of time in the past.

> _“This is not one to miss if you have any spare time while you are in Hamburg even if it might not sound like your thing, it blew my mind the first time I saw it in 2017!”

### [Strandperle](https://www.strandperle-hamburg.de)

Just because you're in the city doesn't mean you can't visit the beach. Strandperle is a stalwart in Hamburg's sandy stretch along the Elbe River, which is dotted with sunbathers and swimmers in the warmer months. With a large deck of tables, chairs, and umbrellas, a bar, kitchen, and the harbor in the backdrop, Strandperle is a favourite place to hang out for locals and tourists alike. Open all day Friday to Sunday, you can enjoy beer and a burger here on a visit, catch-up with cocktails and friends, or hire out the 'upper deck' for an intimate dinner party.

### [Dialogue in the Dark](https://www.dialogue-se.com/what-we-do/dialogue-in-the-dark/)

Dialogue in the Dark is one of the world’s most exciting life-changing experiences where visitors are guided by blind guides in absolute darkness. You get the chance to experience daily environments from a completely new perspective when you enjoy a walk in the park, take a boat cruise, or visit a café in our specially designed darkened rooms. Daily routines become exciting, and a reversal of roles is created where the sighted become blind and the blind become sighted.

Dialogue in the Dark pushes you out of your comfort zone, orienting you to a world without pictures. The blind guides are masters of this environment and hence provide the visitors with a sense of security. For more than 34 years, Dialogue in the Dark has been presented in more than 47 countries throughout Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Millions of visitors have been led through the exhibition by thousands of blind individuals and learned to see in the darkness.
